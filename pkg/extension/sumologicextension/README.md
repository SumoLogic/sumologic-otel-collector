# Sumo Logic Extension

**This extension is experimental and may receive breaking changes at any time.**

This extension is to be used as part of Sumo Logic collector in conjuction with
[`sumologicexporter`][sumologicexporter] in order to export telemetry data to
[Sumo Logic][sumologic].

It manages:

* authentication (passing the provided credentials to `sumologicexporter`
  when configured as extension in the same service)
* registration (storing the registration info locally after successful registration
  for later use)
* heartbeats

[sumologicexporter]: ../../exporter/sumologicexporter/
[sumologic]: https://www.sumologic.com/

## Implementation

It implements [`HTTPClientAuthenticator`][httpclientauthenticator]
and can be used as an authenticator for the
[`configauth.Authentication`][configauth_authentication] option for HTTP clients.

[httpclientauthenticator]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/2e84285efc665798d76773b9901727e8836e9d8f/config/configauth/clientauth.go#L34-L39
