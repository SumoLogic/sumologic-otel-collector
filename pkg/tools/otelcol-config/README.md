# otelcol-config

`otelcol-config` manipulates files in /etc/otelcol-config/conf.d (or in a
user-specified config directory).

It is used by the install.sh script to configure the collector for first-time
use, and also to adjust the collector configuration after installation.

Run `otelcol-config --help` for usage information.
