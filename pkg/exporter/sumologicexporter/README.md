# Sumo Logic Exporter

**Stability level**: Beta

This exporter supports sending logs and metrics data to [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/).

We strongly recommend to use this exporter with [sumologicextension](../../extension/sumologicextension/README.md).

Configuration is specified via the yaml in the following structure:

```yaml
exporters:
  # ...
  sumologic:
    # unique URL generated for your HTTP Source, this is the address to send data to
    # deprecated, please use sumologicextension to manage your endpoints
    # if sumologicextension is not being used, the endpoint is required
    endpoint: <HTTP_Source_URL>
    # Compression encoding format, empty string means no compression, default = gzip
    compress_encoding: {gzip, deflate, ""}
    # max HTTP request body size in bytes before compression (if applied),
    # NOTE: this limit does not apply to data sent in otlp format,
    #   to limit size of otlp requests, please use the batch processor:
    #   https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/v0.78.2/processor/batchprocessor
    # default = 1_048_576 (1MB)
    max_request_body_size: <max_request_body_size>

    # format to use when sending logs to Sumo Logic, default = otlp,
    # NOTE: only `otlp` is supported when used with sumologicextension
    log_format: {json, text, otlp}

    # format to use when sending metrics to Sumo Logic, default = otlp,
    # NOTE: only `otlp` is supported when used with sumologicextension
    metric_format: {otlp, prometheus}

    # format to use when sending traces to Sumo Logic,
    # currently only otlp is supported
    trace_format: {otlp}

    # timeout is the timeout for every attempt to send data to the backend,
    # maximum connection timeout is 55s, default = 5s
    timeout: <timeout>

    # defines if timestamp for logs should be set to 0,
    # it indicates that backend will extract timestamp from logs,
    # this option affects OTLP format only
    # default = true
    clear_logs_timestamp: {true, false}

    # name of resource attribute which should be dropped for records
    # this is for attribute used by routing processor
    # other attributes should be removed by processors in pipelines before
    # This is workaround for the following issue:
    # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/issues/7407
    # default = ``
    routing_atttribute_to_drop: <routing_atttribute_to_drop>

    json_logs:
      # defines which key will be used to attach the log body at.
      # This option affects JSON log format only.
      # By default this is "log".
      log_key: <log>
      # defines whether to include a timestamp field when sending
      # JSON logs, which would contain UNIX epoch timestamp in milliseconds.
      # This option affects JSON log format only.
      # default = true.
      add_timestamp: {true, false}
      # when add_timestamp is set to true then this key defines what is the name
      # of the timestamp key.
      # default = "timestamp".
      timestamp_key: <timestamp_key>
      # When flatten_body is set to true and log is a map,
      # log's body is going to be flattened and `log_key` won't be used
      # default = false
      flatten_body: {true, false}

    # instructs sumologicexporter to use an edpoint automatically generated by
    # sumologicextension;
    # to use direct endpoint, set it `auth` to `null` and set the endpoint configuration
    # option;
    # see sumologicextension documentation for details
    # default = sumologic
    auth:
      authenticator: <sumologicextension_name>

    # for below described queueing and retry related configuration please refer to:
    # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#configuration

    retry_on_failure:
      # default = true
      enabled: {true, false}
      # time to wait after the first failure before retrying;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 5s
      initial_interval: <initial_interval>
      # is the upper bound on backoff; ignored if enabled is false, default = 30s
      max_interval: <max_interval>
      # is the maximum amount of time spent trying to send a batch;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 120s
      max_elapsed_time: <max_elapsed_time>

    sending_queue:
      # default = false
      enabled: {true, false}
      # number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if enabled is false,
      # default = 10
      num_consumers: <num_consumers>
      # when set, enables persistence and uses the component specified as a storage extension for the persistent queue
      # make sure to configure and add a `file_storage` extension in `service.extensions`.
      # default = None
      storage: <storage_name>
      # maximum number of batches kept in memory before data;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 5000
      #
      # user should calculate this as num_seconds * requests_per_second where:
      # num_seconds is the number of seconds to buffer in case of a backend outage,
      # requests_per_second is the average number of requests per seconds.
      queue_size: <queue_size>
```

## Metrics

The Sumo Logic Exporter exposes the following metrics:

- `otelcol_exporter_requests_bytes` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in bytes)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_duration` (`counter`) - duration of HTTP requests (in milliseconds)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_records` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in number of records)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_sent` (`counter`) - number of HTTP requests

All of the above metrics have the following dimensions:

- `endpoint` - endpoint address
- `exporter` - exporter name
- `pipeline` - pipeline name (`logs`, `metrics` or `traces`)
- `status_code` - HTTP response status code (`0` in case of error)
