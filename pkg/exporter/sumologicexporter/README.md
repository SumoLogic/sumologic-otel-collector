# Sumo Logic Exporter

**Stability level**: Beta

This exporter supports sending logs and metrics data to [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/).

We strongly recommend to use this exporter with [sumologicextension](../../extension/sumologicextension/README.md).

Configuration is specified via the yaml in the following structure:

```yaml
exporters:
  # ...
  sumologic:
    # unique URL generated for your HTTP Source, this is the address to send data to
    # deprecated, please use sumologicextension to manage your endpoints
    # if sumologicextension is not being used, the endpoint is required
    endpoint: <HTTP_Source_URL>
    # Compression encoding format, empty string means no compression, default = gzip
    # DEPRECATION NOTICE: compress_encoding (reason: use compression)
    compress_encoding: {gzip, deflate, ""}
    # Compression encoding format, empty string means no compression, default = gzip
    compression: {gzip, zstd, deflate, ""}
    # max HTTP request body size in bytes before compression (if applied),
    # NOTE: this limit does not apply to data sent in otlp format,
    #   to limit size of otlp requests, please use the batch processor:
    #   https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/v0.99.0/processor/batchprocessor
    # default = 1_048_576 (1MB)
    max_request_body_size: <max_request_body_size>

    # format to use when sending logs to Sumo Logic, default = otlp,
    # NOTE: only `otlp` is supported when used with sumologicextension
    log_format: {json, text, otlp}

    # format to use when sending metrics to Sumo Logic, default = otlp,
    # NOTE: only `otlp` is supported when used with sumologicextension
    metric_format: {otlp, prometheus}

    # Decompose OTLP Histograms into individual metrics, similar to how they're represented in Prometheus format.
    # The Sumo OTLP source currently doesn't support Histograms, and they are quietly dropped. This option produces
    # metrics similar to when metric_format is set to prometheus.
    # default = false
    decompose_otlp_histograms: {true, false}

    # format to use when sending traces to Sumo Logic,
    # currently only otlp is supported
    trace_format: {otlp}

    # timeout is the timeout for every attempt to send data to the backend,
    # maximum connection timeout is 55s, default = 30s
    timeout: <timeout>

    # defines client name used for Sumo Logic statistics
    # default = "otelcol"
    client: <client name>

    # instructs sumologicexporter to use an edpoint automatically generated by
    # sumologicextension;
    # to use direct endpoint, set it `auth` to `null` and set the endpoint configuration
    # option;
    # see sumologicextension documentation for details
    # default = sumologic
    auth:
      authenticator: <sumologicextension_name>

    # for below described queueing and retry related configuration please refer to:
    # https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/exporter/exporterhelper/README.md#configuration

    retry_on_failure:
      # default = true
      enabled: {true, false}
      # time to wait after the first failure before retrying;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 5s
      initial_interval: <initial_interval>
      # is the upper bound on backoff; ignored if enabled is false, default = 30s
      max_interval: <max_interval>
      # is the maximum amount of time spent trying to send a batch;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 120s
      max_elapsed_time: <max_elapsed_time>

    sending_queue:
      # default = false
      enabled: {true, false}
      # number of consumers that dequeue batches; ignored if enabled is false,
      # default = 10
      num_consumers: <num_consumers>
      # when set, enables persistence and uses the component specified as a storage extension for the persistent queue
      # make sure to configure and add a `file_storage` extension in `service.extensions`.
      # default = None
      storage: <storage_name>
      # maximum number of batches kept in memory before data;
      # ignored if enabled is false, default = 1000
      #
      # user should calculate this as num_seconds * requests_per_second where:
      # num_seconds is the number of seconds to buffer in case of a backend outage,
      # requests_per_second is the average number of requests per seconds.
      queue_size: <queue_size>

    # defines if sticky session support is enable
    # more details about sticky sessions for ALB could be found here:
    # https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/sticky-sessions.html
    # default = false
    sticky_session_enabled: {true, false}
```

## Metrics

The Sumo Logic Exporter exposes the following metrics:

- `otelcol_exporter_requests_bytes` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in bytes)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_duration` (`counter`) - duration of HTTP requests (in milliseconds)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_records` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in number of records)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_sent` (`counter`) - number of HTTP requests

All of the above metrics have the following dimensions:

- `endpoint` - endpoint address
- `exporter` - exporter name
- `pipeline` - pipeline name (`logs`, `metrics` or `traces`)
- `status_code` - HTTP response status code (`0` in case of error)

## Example Configuration

  sumologic:
    installation_token: <token>

    scrapers:
      load:

exporters:
  sumologic:

processors:
  source:
    source_category: "custom category"
    source_name: "custom name"
    source_host: "%{k8s.pod.name}"

service:
  extensions: [sumologic]
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      processors: [source]
      exporters: [sumologic]
```

### Example without sumologicextension
