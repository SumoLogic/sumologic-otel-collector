# Sumo Logic Exporter

This exporter supports sending logs and metrics data to [Sumo Logic](https://www.sumologic.com/).

We strongly recommend to use this exporter with [sumologicextension](../../extension/sumologicextension/README.md).

Configuration is specified via the yaml in the following structure:

```yaml
exporters:
  # ...
  sumologic:

    # deprecated, please use sumologicextension to manage your endpoints

    # Compression encoding format, empty string means no compression, default = gzip
    compress_encoding: {gzip, deflate, ""}
    # max HTTP request body size in bytes before compression (if applied),

    # NOTE: only `otlp` is supported when used with sumologicextension
    metric_format: {carbon2, graphite, otlp, prometheus}

    # format to use when sending traces to Sumo,
    # currently only otlp is supported

    # maximum connection timeout is 55s, default = 5s

## Attribute translation

Attribute translation changes some of the attribute keys from OpenTelemetry convention to Sumo convention.
For example, OpenTelemetry convention for the attribute containing Kubernetes pod name is `k8s.pod.name`,
but Sumo expects it to be in attribute named `pod`.

If attribute with target name eg. `pod` already exists,
translation is not being done for corresponding attribute (`k8s.pod.name` in this example).

This feature is turned on by default.
To turn it off, set the `translate_attributes` configuration option to `false`.
Note that this may cause some of Sumo apps, built-in dashboards to not work correctly.

Below is a list of all attribute keys that are being translated.

| OTC key name              | Sumo key name      |
|---------------------------|--------------------|
| `cloud.account.id`        | `AccountId`        |
| `cloud.availability_zone` | `AvailabilityZone` |
| `cloud.platform`          | `aws_service`      |
| `cloud.region`            | `Region`           |
| `host.id`                 | `InstanceId`       |
| `host.name`               | `host`             |
| `host.type`               | `InstanceType`     |
| `k8s.cluster.name`        | `Cluster`          |
| `k8s.container.name`      | `container`        |
| `k8s.daemonset.name`      | `daemonset`        |
| `k8s.deployment.name`     | `deployment`       |
| `k8s.namespace.name`      | `namespace`        |
| `k8s.node.name`           | `node`             |
| `k8s.service.name`        | `service`          |
| `k8s.pod.hostname`        | `host`             |
| `k8s.pod.name`            | `pod`              |
| `k8s.pod.uid`             | `pod_id`           |
| `k8s.replicaset.name`     | `replicaset`       |
| `k8s.statefulset.name`    | `statefulset`      |
| `service.name`            | `service`          |
| `file.path.resolved`      | `_sourceName`      |

## Source Templates

You can specify a template with an attribute for `source_category`, `source_name`,
`source_host` or `graphite_template` using `%{attr_name}`. Only *resource* attributes
can be used this way.

For example, when there is an attribute `my_attr`: `my_value`, `metrics/%{my_attr}`
would be expanded to `metrics/my_value`.
Use OpenTelemetry attribute names like `k8s.pod.name` instead of `pod`,
even when [attribute translation](#attribute-translation)
is turned on.

For `graphite_template`, in addition to above, `%{_metric_}` is going to be replaced
with metric name.

If an attribute is not found, it is replaced with `undefined`.
For example, `%{existing_attr}/%{nonexistent_attr}` becomes `value-of-existing-attr/undefined`.

## Metrics

The Sumo Logic Exporter exposes the following metrics:

- `otelcol_exporter_requests_bytes` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in bytes)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_duration` (`counter`) - duration of HTTP requests (in milliseconds)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_records` (`counter`) - total size of HTTP requests (in number of records)
- `otelcol_exporter_requests_sent` (`counter`) - number of HTTP requests

All of the above metrics have the following dimensions:

- `endpoint` - endpoint address
- `exporter` - exporter name
- `pipeline` - pipeline name (`logs`, `metrics` or `traces`)
- `status_code` - HTTP response status code (`0` in case of error)

## Example Configuration

    scrapers:
      load:

exporters:
  sumologic:
    source_category: "custom category"
    source_name: "custom name"
    source_host: "%{k8s.pod.name}"

service:
  extensions: [sumologic]
  pipelines:
    metrics:
      receivers: [hostmetrics]
      exporters: [sumologic]
```

### Example without sumologicextension

  sumologic:
    endpoint: http://localhost:3000
    compress_encoding: "gzip"
    max_request_body_size: "1_048_576"  # 1MB
    log_format: "text"

    source_category: "custom category"
    source_name: "custom name"
    source_host: "custom host"

      load:

service:
  extensions:
  - file_storage
  pipelines:
