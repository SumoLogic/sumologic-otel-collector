# Vagrant Windows environments

These environments are intended for development and troubleshooting of Windows-specific functionality.

## Prerequisites

See [the following document](../README.md) on how to install Vagrant.

## Structure

There's a Vagrantfile provided for each supported Windows version. To use a particular image, just `cd` into the
directory of your choice.

## Setting up

You can set up the Vagrant environment with just one command:

```bash
vagrant up
```

After successfull installation you can ssh to the virtual machine with:

```bash
vagrant ssh
```

> [!NOTE]:
> The directory with sumologic-otel-collector repository on the host is synced with the `C:\sumologic\` directory on the virtual machine.

### Shell

The default shell is Powershell. Bash is also available, and required if you actually want to build Otelcol in the
Windows VM. You can start `bash` by running:

```powershell
bash
```

### ARM hosts (Apple M1, and so on)

You can use [UTM](https://mac.getutm.app/) or any other VM provider that supports M1, and manually run the [provisioning script](provision.ps1) inside
your VM.

TODO: Try and make this work with Vagrant.

## Building the application

After starting `bash` as per the previous section, you can use the same command as on Unix. So:

```bash
make install-builder
make build
```

to build the binary.

## Building Windows containers

Use the [docker](docker/) machine, as it comes with Docker for Windows installed and configured. After building
the application, you can build a Windows container the following way:

```bash
cp otelcolbuilder/cmd/otelcol-sumo.exe .
make build-push-container-windows-dev PLATFORM=windows/amd64/ltsc2022
docker run public.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector-dev:latest-windows-amd64-ltsc2022 --version
```
