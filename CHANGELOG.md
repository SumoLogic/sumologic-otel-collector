## [v0.50.0-sumo-0]

### Released 2022-04-29

Aside from upstream changes, this release only contains a performance fix to metrics batching in the Sumo Logic exporter.
The performance improvement is very substantial, so we recommend upgrading to this version immediately after `0.49.0-sumo-0`.

### Changed

- chore: update OT core to 0.50.0 [#562][#562]

### Fixed

- fix: fix(sumologicexporter): batch metrics if source headers match [#561][#561]

## [v0.49.0-sumo-0]

### Released 2022-04-26

This release includes two breaking changes. One is an upstream change to the configuration syntax of several
log receivers, most notably the `filelog` receiver. The other changes how the Sumo Logic exporter determines
metadata based on the attributes of a OpenTelemetry record. Please consult the upgrade guides linked below
for more details.

### Breaking changes

- chore(deps): bump golang from 1.18 to 1.18.1 [#546][#546]
- chore: bump Telegraf to v1.22.0-sumo-3 [#557][#557]

## [v0.47.0-sumo-0]

### Released 2022-04-05

Welcome to the Sumo Logic OT Distro Collector!

With this release, we are officially out of beta status and in GA, as in General Availability. ðŸŽ‰

This means the software is ready to be used by all customers (without signing up for beta program)
and is commercially fully supported by Sumo Logic in production environments.

Starting with this release, we are using upstream [OpenTelemetry Collector][otc] version numbers
as the base for the OT Distro version numbers.
This means that Sumo Logic OT Distro Collector `v0.47.0-sumo-0` is based on `v0.47.0`
of the OpenTelemetry Collector [core][otc_v0_47_0] and [contrib][contrib_v0_47_0] packages.

[otc]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector
[otc_v0_47_0]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/releases/v0.47.0
[contrib_v0_47_0]: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/releases/v0.47.0

### Fixed

- fix(k8sprocessor): fix metadata dependencies by @astencel-sumo [#513]

### Other

- refactor(sumologicexporter): optimize fields stringification by @pmalek-sumo [#517]
- refactor(sumologicexporter): optimize compressor using sync.Pool by @pmalek-sumo [#518]
