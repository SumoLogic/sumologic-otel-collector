## [v0.47.0-sumo-0]

### Released 2022-04-05

Welcome to the Sumo Logic OT Distro Collector!

With this release, we are officially out of beta status and in GA, as in General Availability. ðŸŽ‰

This means the software is ready to be used by all customers (without signing up for beta program)
and is commercially fully supported by Sumo Logic in production environments.

Starting with this release, we are using upstream [OpenTelemetry Collector][otc] version numbers
as the base for the OT Distro version numbers.
This means that Sumo Logic OT Distro Collector `v0.47.0-sumo-0` is based on `v0.47.0`
of the OpenTelemetry Collector [core][otc_v0_47_0] and [contrib][contrib_v0_47_0] packages.
