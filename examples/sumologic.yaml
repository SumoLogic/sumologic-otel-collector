processors:

  ## Configuration for Memory Limiter Processor
  ## The memory_limiter processor is used to prevent out of memory situations on the collector.
  ## ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/tree/main/processor/memorylimiterprocessor
  memory_limiter:
    ## check_interval is the time between measurements of memory usage for the
    ## purposes of avoiding going over the limits. Defaults to zero, so no
    ## checks will be performed. Values below 1 second are not recommended since
    ## it can result in unnecessary CPU consumption.
    check_interval: 5s
    ## Maximum amount of memory, in %, targeted to be allocated by the process heap.
    limit_percentage: 75
    ## Spike limit (calculated from available memory). Must be less than limit_percentage.
    spike_limit_percentage: 20

  ## Configuration for Batch Processor
  ## The batch processor accepts records and places them into batches grouped by node and resource
  ## ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector/blob/main/processor/batchprocessor
  batch:
    ## Number of records after which a batch will be sent regardless of time
    send_batch_size: 1_024
    ## Time duration after which a batch will be sent regardless of size
    timeout: 1s

  ## Configuration for Sumo Logic Schema Processor
  ## The Sumo Logic Schema processor modifies the metadata on logs, metrics and traces sent to Sumo Logic
  ## so that the Sumo Logic apps can make full use of the ingested data.
  ## ref: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/tree/main/pkg/processor/sumologicschemaprocessor
  sumologic_schema:

  ## Configuration for Resource Detection Processor
  ## The resource detection processor can be used to detect resource information from the host, in a format that conforms to the
  ## OpenTelemetry resource semantic conventions, and append or override the resource value in telemetry data with this information.
  ## ref: https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/tree/main/processor/resourcedetectionprocessor
