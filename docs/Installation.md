## Standalone

The Sumo Logic OT Distro is a static Go binary.
To run it as a standalone process you only need to run the binary file downloaded from
[Github releases][github_releases] with an appropriate configuration.

Follow the steps for your platform below.

### Linux on amd64 (x86-64)

1. Download the release binary:

    ```bash
    curl -sLo otelcol-sumo "https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.50.0-sumo-0/otelcol-sumo-0.50.0-sumo-0-linux_amd64"
    ```

1. Install the release binary in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    chmod +x otelcol-sumo
    sudo mv otelcol-sumo /usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo
    ```

1. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    otelcol-sumo --version
    ```

1. Prepare the configuration according to [this](Configuration.md) document and save it in `config.yaml`.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
> It is recommended to limit access to the configuration file as it contains sensitive information.
> You can change access permissions to the configuration file using:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 640 config.yaml
> ```

1. Run Sumo Logic OT Distro:

   ```bash
   otelcol-sumo --config config.yaml
   ```

### Linux on arm64

1. Download the release binary:

    ```bash
    curl -sLo otelcol-sumo "https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.50.0-sumo-0/otelcol-sumo-0.50.0-sumo-0-linux_arm64"
    ```

1. Install the release binary in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    chmod +x otelcol-sumo
    sudo mv otelcol-sumo /usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo
    ```

1. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    otelcol-sumo --version
    ```

1. Prepare the configuration according to [this](Configuration.md) document and save it in `config.yaml`.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
> It is recommended to limit access to the configuration file as it contains sensitive information.
> You can change access permissions to the configuration file using:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 640 config.yaml
> ```

1. Run Sumo Logic OT Distro:

   ```bash
   otelcol-sumo --config config.yaml
   ```

### MacOS on amd64 (x86-64)

1. Download the release binary:

    ```bash
    curl -sLo otelcol-sumo "https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/releases/download/v0.50.0-sumo-0/otelcol-sumo-0.50.0-sumo-0-darwin_amd64"
    ```

1. Install the release binary in your `PATH`:

    ```bash
    chmod +x otelcol-sumo
    sudo mv otelcol-sumo /usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo
    ```

1. Verify the installation:

    ```bash
    otelcol-sumo --version
    ```

1. Prepare the configuration according to [this](Configuration.md) document and save it in `config.yaml`.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
> It is recommended to limit access to the configuration file as it contains sensitive information.
> You can change access permissions to the configuration file using:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 640 config.yaml
> ```

1. Run Sumo Logic OT Distro:

   ```bash
   otelcol-sumo --config config.yaml
   ```

### MacOS on arm64 (Apple M1) (x86-64)

This is currently not a supported platform. Manually building for it might work, but we haven't tested it.

### Upgrading standalone installation

To upgrade, simply perform the above installation steps again,
overwriting the `otelcol-sumo` binary with newer version.

Before running the newer version, make sure to check the [release notes][github_releases]
for potential breaking changes that would require manual migration steps.

## Container image

To run the Sumo Logic OT Distro in a container, you only need to run the container
using the image available in the
[public.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector](https://gallery.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector)
repository.

1. Set the release version variable:

   ```bash
   export RELEASE_VERSION=0.50.0-sumo-0
   ```

1. Prepare the configuration according to [this](Configuration.md) document and save it in `config.yaml`.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
> It is recommended to limit access to the configuration file as it contains sensitive information.
> You can change access permissions to the configuration file using:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 640 config.yaml
> ```

1. Run the Sumo Logic OT Distro in container, e.g.

    ```bash
    $ docker run --rm -ti --name sumologic-otel-collector -v "$(pwd)/config.yaml:/etc/config.yaml" "public.ecr.aws/sumologic/sumologic-otel-collector:${RELEASE_VERSION}" --config /etc/config.yaml

### Important note about local state files when using `sumologicextension`

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
>
> When running Sumo Logic OT distro in a container with [`sumologicextension`][sumologicextension],
> one needs to take into account the local state files which are being used locally
> in order to store collector credentials upon successful collector registration.
>
> When the collector is being run with `sumologicextension` (which manages collector
> registration), local directory (which is configured via `collector_credentials_directory`
> in `sumologicextension`, and which is by default set to `$HOME/.sumologic-otel-collector`)
> will be used to store the aforementioned state files.
> Without any mounts defined on the container the collector will register itself
> every time it starts up, creating clutter on Sumo Logic Collector Management page.
>
> In order to avoid that, use volume mounts or any other mechanism to mount
> the collector credentials directory to the container to persist the state
> or use `clobber` configuration option from `sumologicextension` to force collector
> re-registering under the same name, every time is starts up.
>
> One can read more about the above described mechanism in
> [`sumologicextension` README.md][sumologicextension_storing_credentials].

## Systemd Service

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
>
> Make sure that the user that will run the `otelcol-sumo` process has access to
> any directories within your filesystem that have been used in you configuration.
>
> For instance, using [filestorage extension][filestorage_help] in your configuration
> like so:
>
> ```yaml
> extensions:
>   file_storage/custom_settings:
>     directory: /var/lib/otelcol/mydir
>     timeout: 1s
> ```
>
> will require that the user running the process has access to `/var/lib/otelcol/mydir`.

To run opentelemetry collector as Systemd Service please apply following steps:

1. Ensure that `otelcol-sumo` [has been installed](#linux-on-amd64-x86-64) into `/usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo`:

   ```bash
   /usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo --version
   ```

1. Create configuration file and save it as `/etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml`.

> **IMPORTANT NOTE**:
> It is recommended to limit access to the configuration file as it contains sensitive information.
> You can change access permissions to the configuration file using:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 640 config.yaml
> ```

1. Create `user` and `group` to run opentelemetry by:

   ```bash
   sudo useradd -rUs /bin/false opentelemetry
   ```

1. Ensure that `/etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml` can be accessed by `opentelemetry` user
   which will be used to run the service.

   ```bash
   $ ls -la /etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml
   -rw-r--r-- 1 opentelemetry daemon 0 Feb 16 16:23 /etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml
   ```

1. Verify if opentelemetry collector runs without errors:

   ```bash
   sudo su -s /bin/bash opentelemetry -c '/usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo --config /etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml'
   ```

1. Create service file: `/etc/systemd/system/otelcol-sumo.service`:

   ```conf
   [Unit]
   Description=Sumologic Opentelemetry Collector

   [Service]
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/otelcol-sumo --config /etc/otelcol-sumo/config.yaml
   User=opentelemetry
   Group=opentelemetry
   MemoryHigh=200M
   MemoryMax=300M
   TimeoutStopSec=20

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   ```

   _Note: adjust memory configuration to your setup._

1. Enable autostart of the service:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable otelcol-sumo
   ```

1. Start service and check status:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start otelcol-sumo
   sudo systemctl status otelcol-sumo  # checks status
   sudo journalctl -u otelcol-sumo  # checks logs
   ```
