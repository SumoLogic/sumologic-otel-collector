## How to release

### Update Changelog

Edit the [CHANGELOG.md][changelog] file and add an entry for the release that will be created.

Here are some example pull requests: [#585], [#563].

[#563]: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/pull/563
[#585]: https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/pull/585

### Create and push Git tag

In order to release a new version of Sumo OT distro you'd export `TAG` env variable
and create a tag and push it.

This can be done using `add-tag` and `push-tag` `make` targets which will handle
that for you as well as pushing tags for all the plugins in this repo so that
they can be imported from other repositories.

```shell
export TAG=v0.51.0-sumo-0
make add-tag push-tag
```

> **NOTE**:
>
> [Release build CI job][release_job]
> is additionally using the `prepare-tag` `make` target in order to substitute
> the version placeholders in [opentelemetry collector builder config][builder_config]
> so that the versions in the released binary match the repository tag.
>
> If you'd like to build a binary to mimic the release binary you'd have to run
> that yourself like so:
>
> ```shell
> make prepare-tag TAG=$(git describe --tags --abbrev=10 --match "v[0-9]*")
> ```

### Publish GitHub release

The GitHub release is created as draft by the [create-release](../.github/workflows/release_builds.yml) GitHub Action.

After the release draft is created, go to [GitHub releases](https://github.com/SumoLogic/sumologic-otel-collector/releases),
edit the release draft and fill in missing information:

- Specify versions for upstream OT core and contrib releases
- Copy and paste the Changelog entry for this release from [CHANGELOG.md][changelog]

After verifying that the release text and all links are good, publish the release.

## Updating OT core

Updating OT core involves:

1. Rebasing our upstream processor patches on the new core version
1. Updating the version number where necessary
1. Verifying that Sumo OT distro builds correctly
1. Fixing lint errors from deprecations
1. Add missing upstream components

### Updating patched processors

We currently maintain patches for three upstream processors: `resourceprocessor`, `attributesprocessor` and `filterprocessor`.
The patches live in our [contrib fork repository][contrib_fork], on the `vX.X.X-filterprocessor` branch. See [comments][builder_config]
in the builder configuration for more details.

To update this patchset for the new OT core version:

1. Checkout the contrib fork repo, add upstream as a remote, and pull the new version tag.

   ```bash
   export CURRENT_VERSION=vX.X.X
   export NEW_VERSION=vY.Y.Y
   export SUFFIX=filterprocessor
   git clone https://github.com/SumoLogic/opentelemetry-collector-contrib && cd opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib
   git pull upstream "${NEW_VERSION}" "${CURRENT_VERSION}"
   ```

1. Create a new branch for the patchset and rebase it on the new version

   ```bash
   git switch "${CURRENT_VERSION}-${SUFFIX}"
   git checkout -b "${NEW_VERSION}-${SUFFIX}"
   git rebase -i --onto "${NEW_VERSION}" "${CURRENT_VERSION}" "${NEW_VERSION}-${SUFFIX}"
   ```

1. Resolve conflicts and make sure tests and linters pass afterwards.
   You can run them by invoking the following in the project root:

   ```bash
   make install-tools
   make golint
   make gotest
   ```

   If the command `make gotest` fails on unrelated tests, like for example `kafkareceiver`,
   only run the tests for the changed modules:

   ```bash
   make -C internal/coreinternal test && make -C processor/attributesprocessor test && make -C processor/filterprocessor test && make -C processor/resourceprocessor test
   ```

1. Push the new branch to the fork repo and write down the commit SHA

   ```bash
   git push origin "${NEW_VERSION}-${SUFFIX}"
   ```

1. Update the [builder configuration][builder_config] with the new commit SHA

1. Repeat above steps with the following change:

   ```bash
   export SUFFIX=stanza
   ```

### Updating OT distro

The second and third step of this list are covered by the `update-ot-core` Makefile target. Run:

```shell
make update-ot-core OT_CORE_NEW_VERSION=x.x.x
```

to carry these steps out.
Afterwards, you can run tests and check for lint errors by running:

```shell
make golint
make gotest
```

in the repository root.

### Add missing upstream components

We include all of the components from the following list:

- [OpenTelemetry receivers][OT_receivers]
- [OpenTelemetry processors][OT_processors]
- [OpenTelemetry exporters][OT_exporters]
- [OpenTelemetry extensions][OT_extensions]
- [OpenTelemetry Contrib receivers][OTC_receivers]
- [OpenTelemetry Contrib processors][OTC_processors]
- [OpenTelemetry Contrib extensions][OTC_extensions]

As a fourth step, please check [OpenTelemetry Collector][OT_release] and [OpenTelemetry Collector Contrib][OTC_release]
release pages for new components and update [builder configuration][builder_config] and [README.md] if they are any.
Please consider example pull request: [#604]

#### Adding components from scratch

This shouldn't be required as long as list of components is regularly updated,
but in case you want to generate full list of components, the following instruction can be helpful:

1. [update builder configuration][builder_config]
   You can use the following snippet inside [OpenTelemetry Contrib repository][OTC_repository]
   in order to get list of components:

   ```bash
   export TAG=vx.y.z
   git fetch --all
   git checkout "${TAG}"
   for dir in receiver processor extension; do
     echo "###############${dir}s###############"
     for file in $(ls "${dir}"); do
       echo "  - gomod: \"github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-collector-contrib/${dir}/${file} ${TAG}\"";
     done;
   done;
   ```

1. Run `make build` in order to generate updated components file (`otelcolbuilder/cmd/components.go`)
1. Update markdown table:

   1. Prepare `local/receiver.txt`, `local/exporter.txt`, `local/extension.txt` and `local/processor.txt`
      in [OpenTelemetry Contrib repository][OTC_repository] based on components file.
      Example content of `local/extension.txt`:

      ```text
      sumologicextension.NewFactory(),
      ballastextension.NewFactory(),
      zpagesextension.NewFactory(),
      asapauthextension.NewFactory(),
      awsproxy.NewFactory(),
      basicauthextension.NewFactory(),
      bearertokenauthextension.NewFactory(),
      fluentbitextension.NewFactory(),
      healthcheckextension.NewFactory(),
      httpforwarder.NewFactory(),
      jaegerremotesampling.NewFactory(),
      oauth2clientauthextension.NewFactory(),
      dockerobserver.NewFactory(),
      ecsobserver.NewFactory(),
      ecstaskobserver.NewFactory(),
      hostobserver.NewFactory(),
      k8sobserver.NewFactory(),
      oidcauthextension.NewFactory(),
      pprofextension.NewFactory(),
      sigv4authextension.NewFactory(),
      filestorage.NewFactory(),
      dbstorage.NewFactory(),
      ```

   1. Run the following snippet in order to prepare markdown links for [README.md]:

      ```bash
      for kind in extension processor receiver exporter; do
        echo "#####${kind}#####"
        for component in $(cat local/${kind}.txt | sed "s/\..*//g"); do
          export dir=$(find ${kind} -name "${component}");
          NAME=$(grep -oRP '(?<=typeStr\s)(.*?)=(.*?)"(.*?)"' "${dir}" | grep -oP '\w+"$' | sed 's/"//g');
          echo "[${NAME}][${component}]";
        done 2>/dev/null
      done
      ```

   1. Copy and fix the output
   1. Copy fixed output to spreadsheet. Every component in separate column as in [README.md].
   1. Sort components and add placeholder to empty rows.
      Placeholders make it easier to format table as markdown in next steps.
   1. Copy table into text editor with support for regexp replacement.
   1. Prepare table in markdown format. We recommend to use regexp replacement.
   1. Prepare links for the table. You can use regexp replacement in order to generate it
   1. Carefully analyse `git diff` and fix unwanted changes.

## Running Tracing E2E tests

We currently have some legacy E2E tests ported from [our OT fork][ot_fork], which serve as a means of
verifying feature parity for tracing as we migrate it to this distribution. The tests
are run by CircleCI on demand for `main` and release branches, and are defined [here][tracing_tests].

In order to run the tests, go to the [CircleCI page][circleci], choose the branch you want, and manually
approve the workflow to run. Note that you need commiter rights in this repository to run the tests.

## Updating journalctl

Journalctl is dependency for [journaldreceiver]. In order to update it, please update debian version in Dockerfile files.
Please see available [debian versions][debian_versions].

```bash
export DEBIAN_VERSION=11.3
make update-journalctl
```
