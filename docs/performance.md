## Benchmarks

### Logs

#### Benchmark setup

The following benchmark has been compiled on an Amazon `m4.large`
instance (which has 2 CPU cores and 8 GB of memory available).

It can be used when estimating the required CPU resources for logs collection
using [`filelogreceiver`][filelogreceiver].

#### CPU usage guidelines

##### Benchmark - CPU usage for particular average message size and EPS

Measured CPU usage for particular Events Per Second (EPS) average message size.

|          | 100B  | 512B  |  1KB   |  5KB   |  10KB  |
|:--------:|:-----:|:-----:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| **EPS**  |   -   |   -   |   -    |   -    |   -    |
| **100**  | 1.14% |  1%   | 1.01%  |  1.4%  | 3.78%  |
| **200**  | 1.29% | 1.4%  | 1.41%  | 2.57%  | 5.36%  |
| **500**  | 2.75% | 2.71% | 2.95%  |  5.7%  | 10.68% |
| **1000** | 4.74% | 5.07% | 5.32%  | 11.3%  | 20.12% |
| **1500** | 7.08% | 7.29% | 7.99%  | 16.93% | 27.96% |
| **2000** | 9.64% | 9.56% | 10.39% | 22.51% | 36.59% |

##### Benchmark - EPS for average message size and CPU usage

Events Per Second (EPS) achieved for a particular average message size and CPU usage.

|                       | 100B  | 512B  | 1KB  | 5KB  | 10KB |
|:---------------------:|:-----:|:-----:|:----:|:----:|:----:|
| **Average CPU usage** |   -   |   -   |  -   |  -   |  -   |
|        **5%**         | 2000  | 1100  | 1000 | 150  | 200  |
|        **10%**        | 3500  | 2100  | 1500 | 450  | 300  |
|        **20%**        | 6500  | 4100  | 3000 | 1200 | 700  |
|        **50%**        | 14000 | 10100 | 8500 |  -*  |  -*  |
|        **90%**        |  -*   | 19100 |  -*  |  -*  |  -*  |

\* - cells without a resulting EPS come from the fact that the CPU utilization
didn't reach the designated CPU utilization during the benchmark run.

The above table can be interpreted in the following way:

For an average CPU usage of 5%

- 10 KB logs can be ingested at 200 logs/sec (2000 KB/sec).
- 1 KB logs can be ingested at 1000 logs/sec (1000 KB/sec).

This shows that the collector performs better when it is made to ingest bigger
log entries (which is expected due to less overhead coming from timestamp parsing etc.).

#### Memory usage guidelines

##### Benchmark - memory usage for particular average message size and EPS

Measured memory usage (in MB) for particular Events Per Second (EPS) average message size.

|          |  100B  |  512B  |  1KB   |  5KB   |  10KB  |
|:--------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|:------:|
| **EPS**  |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |   -    |
| **100**  | 113.14 | 116.16 | 117.1  | 116.99 | 112.59 |
| **200**  | 115.16 | 118.55 | 116.8  | 119.67 | 127.02 |
| **500**  | 118.24 | 121.79 | 122.78 | 127.87 | 142.73 |
| **1000** | 121.6  | 126.75 | 127.94 | 140.11 | 106.82 |
| **1500** | 128.54 | 131.9  | 137.69 | 95.21  | 113.89 |
| **2000** | 130.62 | 125.27 | 144.59 | 98.62  | 134.61 |

## Fine Tuning

There are a couple configuration options that can help with performance in specific scenarios.

### Sumo Logic Exporter

The [`sumologicexporter`](../pkg/exporter/sumologicexporter)
sends data to Sumo Logic.

It has the following features that can help with performance:

- `retry_on_failure` with its `initial_interval`, `max_interval` and `max_elapsed_time` settings,
- `sending_queue` with its `num_consumers`, `queue_size` settings,
- `timeout`.

Read more about these features in the [Sumo Logic Exporter docs](../pkg/exporter/sumologicexporter/README.md).

### Batch Processor

The [`batchprocessor`][batchprocessor] joins records of each type in batches.

It has the following features that can help with performance:

- `send_batch_size`,
- `send_batch_max_size`,
- `timeout`.

Read more about these features in the [Batch Processor docs].

### Memory Limiter Processor

The [`memorylimiterprocessor`][memorylimiterprocessor] prevents out-of-memory crashes for the collector process
by monitoring the amount of memory used by the collector and forcing it to lower its memory consumption.

Read more about its features in the [Memory Limiter Processor docs].
